  /// 2. The build phase: All the dirty [Element]s in the widget tree are
  /// rebuilt (see [State.build]). See [State.setState] for further details on
  /// marking a widget dirty for building. See [BuildOwner] for more information
  /// on this step.

  /// out (see [RenderObject.performLayout]). See [RenderObject.markNeedsLayout]
  /// for further details on marking an object dirty for layout.
  ///
  /// 4. The compositing bits phase: The compositing bits on any dirty
  /// [RenderObject] objects are updated. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsCompositingBitsUpdate].
  ///
  /// 5. The paint phase: All the dirty [RenderObject]s in the system are
  /// repainted (see [RenderObject.paint]). This generates the [Layer] tree. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint] for further details on marking an object
  /// dirty for paint.
  ///
  /// 6. The compositing phase: The layer tree is turned into a [ui.Scene] and
  /// sent to the GPU.
  ///
  /// 7. The semantics phase: All the dirty [RenderObject]s in the system have
  /// their semantics updated (see [RenderObject.SemanticsAnnotator]). This
  /// generates the [SemanticsNode] tree. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsSemanticsUpdate] for further details on marking an
  /// object dirty for semantics.
  ///
  /// For more details on steps 3-7, see [PipelineOwner].
  ///
  /// 8. The finalization phase in the widgets layer: The widgets tree is
  /// finalized. This causes [State.dispose] to be invoked on any objects that
  /// were removed from the widgets tree this frame. See
  /// [BuildOwner.finalizeTree] for more details.
  ///
  /// 9. The finalization phase in the scheduler layer: After [beginFrame]
  /// returns, [handleBeginFrame] then invokes post-frame callbacks (registered
  /// with [addPostFrameCallback].
