  /// ### Text
  ///
  /// Text is the canonical example of a width-in-height-out algorithm. The

  ///
  /// Consider the string "Hello World" The _maximum_ intrinsic width (as
  /// returned from [computeMaxIntrinsicWidth]) would be the width of the string
  /// with no line breaks.
  ///
  /// The minimum intrinsic width would be the width of the widest word, "Hello"
  /// or "World". If the text is rendered in an even narrower width, however, it
  /// might still not overflow. For example, maybe the rendering would put a
  /// line-break half-way through the words, as in "Hel⁞lo⁞Wor⁞ld". However,
  /// this wouldn't be a _correct_ rendering, and [computeMinIntrinsicWidth] is
  /// supposed to render the minimum width that the box could be without failing
  /// to _correctly_ paint the contents within itself.
  ///
  /// The minimum intrinsic _height_ for a given width smaller than the minimum
  /// intrinsic width could therefore be greater than the minimum intrinsic
  /// height for the minimum intrinsic width.
  ///
  /// ### Viewports (e.g. scrolling lists)
  ///
  /// Some render boxes are intended to clip their children. For example, the
  /// render box for a scrolling list might always size itself to its parents'
  /// size (or rather, to the maximum incoming constraints), regardless of the
  /// children's sizes, and then clip the children and position them based on
  /// the current scroll offset.
  ///
  /// The intrinsic dimensions in these cases still depend on the children, even
